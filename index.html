    cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

        Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants,
        including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food. In
        Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In
        casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in
        grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked
        using a home oven.
