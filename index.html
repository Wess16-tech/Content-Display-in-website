            In a broader sense, web development refers to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via intranet or
            internet. The web development process includes web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting,
            and network security configuration, among other tasks.

            It is a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of
            web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. 
            Front-end developers are responsible
            for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.
            Back-end developers are responsible for the server data and requests.
            Full-stack developers are the ones who have a good knowledge of both.
